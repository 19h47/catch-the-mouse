# Catch the mouse

No, this repository isn't a toy for your cat.  
Lately, I'm very frustrated with the mouse's coordinates X and Y. So I decided to change this with this repository.

## Styles

A good old CSS stylesheet. Back to the basics. ðŸ˜†

## JavaScript

`Index.js` is the entry point of this package, maybe later, we put this into a dedicated folder.
